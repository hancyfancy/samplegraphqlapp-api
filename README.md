# samplegraphqlapp-api

The application interface which provides endpoints for the user interface to consume. Controllers make the endpoints available via a restrictive cors policy. Authorisation needs to be added to controllers to securely validate request. Currently needs to be run locally, with plans to host in a serverless environment.

## Development server

Run locally via Visual Studio. Request would be sent to `https://localhost:7185/api/Student/BookAndCollegeDetails` endpoint.
